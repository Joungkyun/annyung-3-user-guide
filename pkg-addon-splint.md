### Description:
C 코드 보안/에러 검사 도구

Splint is a tool for statically checking C programs for coding errors and
security vulnerabilities. With minimal effort, Splint can be used as a
better lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs,
Splint can perform even stronger checks than can be done by any standard lint.
