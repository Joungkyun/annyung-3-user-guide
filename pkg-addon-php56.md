# php56

### Description:
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language.  PHP attempts to make it
easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages.  PHP
also offers built-in database integration for several commercial
and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
database-enabled web page with PHP is fairly simple.  The most
common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI
scripts.  The mod_php module enables the Apache web server to
understand and process the embedded PHP language in web pages.
